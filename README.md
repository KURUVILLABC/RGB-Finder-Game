# RGB-Finder-Game
I’ve seen many RGB color guessing games online — but most of them felt too plain. They usually just display a color code with a few boxes, without any engaging design or user experience.

As someone who enjoys both design and game logic, I wanted to create a version that not only tests your knowledge of RGB colors but also makes you want to keep playing because of its look and feel.
